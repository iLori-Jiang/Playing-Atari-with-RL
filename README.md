# Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods

Implement DQN (DQN, Double DQN, Dueling Network) and AC (Actor-Critic, Advantage Actor-Critic) methods with TD Learning, REINFORCE, and Experience Replay strategies.

Run on Colab with GPU accelerated.

Final A2C with REINFORCE model is in '/model'.

GIF of the final model to play the game can be seen in '/gif'.
